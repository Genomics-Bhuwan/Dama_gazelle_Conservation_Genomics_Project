- Fast calculation of Patterson's D (ABBA-BABA) and the f4-ratio statistics across many populations/species
- Input files: A VCF file: can contain multiallelic loci and indels but only biallelic SNPs will be used.
- Population/species map SETS.txt
- contains a .txt file with one individual per row and a tab separating the individual's name from the name of the species/populations it belongs to
Ind1    Species1
Ind2    Species1
Ind3    Species2
Ind4    Species2
Ind5    Species3
Ind6    Outgroup
Ind7    Outgroup
